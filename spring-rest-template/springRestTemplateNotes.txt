Spring RestTemplate:

Spring RestTemplate class is part of spring-web, introduced in Spring 3.
We can use RestTemplate to test HTTP based restful web services, it doesn’t support HTTPS protocol.
RestTemplate class provides overloaded methods for different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.

Jar Dependencies:
We need spring-core, spring-context dependencies for spring framework. 
Then we need spring-web artifact that contains RestTemplate class. 
We also need jackson-mapper-asl for Spring JSON support through Jackson API.

Beans:
We have to define a spring bean for RestTemplate class, that’s done in AppConfig class.
Note that RestTemplate uses MessageConverter and we need to set this property in the RestTemplate bean. 
We are using MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter for fetching data from JSON format.

Final step is to create the client classes that will use RestTemplate bean defined above.
Inside Client methods, we call RestTemplate methods based on the URI and the HTTP method and by passing appropriate request object if needed.
